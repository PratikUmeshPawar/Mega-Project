In this example, we select the parts of the CO that can be changed and replace them with simple dummy functions.
These small changes demonstrate the algorithm's performance in a real-world problem.

Parts that can be replaced by your mock functions:

Line 111: updated the last part of the alpha parameter (in general, different types of functions can be used for alpha parameter)

Line 115: r_Check can be changed to suit your needs and the nature of the problem.

Line 116: Create a new Eq

Line 117: beta can have various values, as shown in lines 118 and 122.

Line 132: The search strategy can be replaced by a variety of functions (a typical example is made)

Line 134: The attack strategy can be updated with a variety of functions (an example is made in line 135). The attack strategy in line 135 is not dependent to beta. 

Sit and Wait strategy has been updated in lines 137 to 141 based on the type of problem.

Uncomment the comment sections and test the algorithm's behavior in different modes.

Be patient, the CO can pass through local optima

Also, put your proposed functions (any functions) to the test.
